# WeatherForecast

This is a Angularjs web-appliation where a user can fetch the weather forecast report using an api

To get an api, one can visit any weather forecast api providers and here in this project I got an api along with the key from weatherapi.com

API key is mandatory irrespective of api providers

Using that single api one can make wonders like showing the geo-location, weatherforecast report nearly for 15 days, historical weatherreport for predictions and astronomy as well.

I've used some of the angularjs concepts like routing, http service, local storage (for persisting of data even after refreshing the page).

Along with the code, I have also attached the demo of this web-app.

Hope you like this small web-app
