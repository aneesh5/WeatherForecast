# WeatherForecast

This is a Angularjs web-appliation where a user can fetch the weather forecast report using an api

To get an api, one can visit any weather forecast api providers and here in this project I got an api along with the key from weatherapi.com

API key is mandatory irrespective of api providers

Using that single api one can make wonders like showing the geo-location, weatherforecast report nearly for 15 days, historical weatherreport for predictions and astronomy as well.

Along with the code, I have also attached the demo of this web-app.

Hope you like this small web-app
